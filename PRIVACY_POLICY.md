# Privacy policy for the app `CAPod`

* I do not collect personal information
* I do not sell, monetize or otherwise misappropriate any collected data.

Anonymous device information may be collected for automatic crash reporting (see [Automatic crash reports](#automatic-crash-reports)).

My underlying privacy princicple is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have further questions.

## Automatic crash reports
The app uses "Bugsnag" for automatic crash reports:

https://www.bugsnag.com/

Bugsnags privacy policy can be found here:

https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/

Crash reports may contain device and app related information.
Personally identifying information is not required to fix bugs and thus not sought by me or the app.

You can disable automatic crash reports in the app's settings.
