# Privacy policy for the app `CAPod`

* I do not collect personal information
* I do not sell, monetize or otherwise misappropriate any collected data.

Anonymous device information may be collected in the event of a crash (see [Automatic crash reports](#automatic-crash-reports)).

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have further questions.

## Automatic crash reports

The app uses "Bugsnag" for automatic crash reports:

https://www.bugsnag.com/

Bugsnags privacy policy can be found here:

https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/

Crash reports may contain device and app related information.

You can disable automatic crash reports in the app's settings.
